邏輯數學問題：如果有12顆外表長得一模一樣的金色的球，裡面11顆重量一樣，只有一顆重量差一點點，還有你有一個用3次後就會壞掉的天平，要如何測試出來哪一顆球是唯一不一樣的呢？

Math Question:
You have 12 balls identical in size and appearance but 1 is an odd weight (could be either light or heavy), and you have a set of balance scales and you have only 3 chances to weight the balls in any combination using the scales. Determine which ball is the odd one and if it's heavier or lighter than the rest. How do you do it?


本專案挑戰將上述的數學問題用Objective-C程式寫出解法，並搭配iOS App專案以及互動UI。
App中可以由使用者指定1顆重量不同的球，並可指定該球是比正常的球重或是輕，並由程式自己找出答案。
所有原始碼都都在本專案中，Enjoy it!

This repositority challenges to solve the question above by writing an Objective-C code and solving the question by its own. Users can choose one ball with an odd weight and can set it's weight heavier or lighter than the rest. The program will do the rest. Enjoy it!
